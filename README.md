I'm a **Full-stack Python Developer** and full-time freelancer based in Yogyakarta, Indonesia. I've been freelancing since 2020. I have experience in Python FastAPI/Django and also React.js/Vue.js. I'm a problem solver and detail oriented programmer. I'm good at using version control like `git`. I use Vim-binding anywhere possible (like in Obsidian and in IDE).
